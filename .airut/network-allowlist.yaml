# Network allowlist for Claude Code containers.
#
# Only hosts listed here are reachable from inside the container.
# All other traffic is blocked by the mitmproxy-based network proxy.
#
# To request access to a new host, add it here and submit a PR.
# See spec/container/network-sandbox.md for details.

# Pattern matching uses fnmatch-style wildcards (* and ?):
#   - "*.github.com" matches "api.github.com" but NOT "github.com"
#   - "/api/*" matches "/api/foo" but NOT "/api"
#   - "/api" matches only "/api" exactly (no implicit prefix matching)

# Domains: all paths allowed (exact match unless wildcards used)
domains:
  # Claude API
  - api.anthropic.com
  - statsig.anthropic.com
  - sentry.io

# URL patterns: domain + path pattern required (fnmatch wildcards supported)
url_prefixes:
  # GitHub - restricted to airutorg/website repository
  - host: github.com
    path: /airutorg/website*
  - host: api.github.com
    path: /repos/airutorg/website*
  - host: api.github.com
    path: /graphql
  - host: uploads.github.com
    path: /repos/airutorg/website*
  - host: raw.githubusercontent.com
    path: /airutorg/website*
